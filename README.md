This is the case study from Versa Asia.

Problem : There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out
the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to
predict when the big bang will happen again.

Solution : Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word
BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it
with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow :

[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”,
.... all the way to 100]

## Instructions to Run the Script

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Compile the Java source file by executing the following command: javac ChallengeBigBang.java
5. Run the compiled code by executing the following command: java ChallengeBigBang
6. After executing the code, the output will be generated and saved to `output.json`.

Please note that you should have write permissions in the directory where you execute the code in order to generate and save the `output.json` file successfully.
